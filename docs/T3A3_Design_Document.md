## Purpose

The _Pok&eacute;decks_ app is designed as an online tool for managing a user/player's _Pok√©mon Trading Card Game_ cards and decks into _decklists_, using _SQLAlchemy_.

Individual decks will be stored in a table, which will hold a list of the individual cards the deck contains.

User information and account details will each be stored in separate tables, where a user is given the option to modify their site preferences (to achieve the one-to-one entity relationship requirement).
